Successes:
Being new to JS/jQuery, there was a lot of trial and error to get some of the simplest functions to work.  I learned SO much along the way and made a few breakthroughs - including html2canvas.

Room for Improvement:
Cleaner (dry-er) code and getting better at responsive design - smoother transitions and fewer breakpoints.
